# Dataclass properties in Python

This is the supporting repository for "Reconciling Dataclasses And Properties In Python", a blog post published on [my blog](https://blog.florimondmanca.com/reconciling-dataclasses-and-properties-in-python) and [dev.to](https://dev.to).

The various Python files here are the attempts presented in the blog post to implement properties on dataclasses â€” which is not an intuitive task.

## Usage

To run an interpreter using any of the attempts, you can make use of Python's `-i` command line argument, which starts a shell after running a script:

```bash
$ python -i 3_field.py
>>> # Start doing things with `Vehicle`!
```
